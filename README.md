# Script Logger

This plugin provides a new script function `$logline()` to write entries to Picard's system log. By default, the log level is set at `Info`, but any level can be used by providing the level as an optional second parameter to the function. The function is available to both user scripts and file naming scripts.

Please see the [User Guide](https://picard-plugins-user-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/script_logger/user_guide.html) for more information, including usage examples.
